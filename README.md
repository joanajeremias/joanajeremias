My journey began in cultural management and event production, but the logic and precision of software development led me to complete a Full Stack Development Bootcamp. Since then, I have worked with various tools and methodologies, focusing on building efficient and well-structured solutions.  

### Technologies  
▪ **Languages:** Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
▪ **Frameworks:** Spring, Hibernate, Bootstrap, jQuery  
▪ **Databases & Tools:** MySQL, Maven, Git, Postman  
▪ **Methodologies:** Agile, SCRUM  
▪ **Additional Exploration:** Cybersecurity fundamentals, UX/UI Design  

### Principles  
▸ **Structure over ornamentation.** Clean, organized, and functional code.  
▸ **Form follows function.** Every project arises from necessity, not excess.  
▸ **Precision and clarity.** Simplicity is not a starting point, but a goal.
